> ### 1. What is Emmet?

Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows for faster and more efficient coding in HTML, XML, and other structured code formats. It uses abbreviations that expand into complete code snippets, saving you `time` and `keystrokes`.`

> ### 2. Difference between a Library and Framework?

**Library**:

**Modular**: Provides specific functionalities you can pick and choose from.
**Flexibility**: You control the overall structure and flow of your application.
**Examples**: jQuery (for manipulation), Django REST framework (for APIs).

**Framework:**

**Holistic:** Offers a complete structure and way of building applications.
**Opinionated:** Enforces specific architectural patterns and conventions.
**Examples:** React (web apps), Spring (enterprise Java apps).
**In short**, libraries are tools in your toolbox, while frameworks are pre-built houses you can decorate.`

> ### 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Imagine it as a network of servers spread across the globe, each holding copies of your website's content. Here's why we use it:

**Speed:** When someone visits your site, their request goes to the nearest CDN server, not your origin server. This reduces the distance data travels, leading to faster loading times and a smoother experience.

**Availability:** If your main server goes down, nearby CDN servers can still deliver content, ensuring high availability even during issues.

**Security:** CDNs can offer security features like DDoS protection and SSL certificates, safeguarding your website and user data.

**Reduced costs:** By offloading traffic from your origin server, CDNs can help manage bandwidth costs and improve overall performance.

So, CDN is all about delivering your content faster, more reliably, and securely to users worldwide.

> ### 4. Why is React known as React?

React got its name because it helps build user interfaces that react quickly to changes in data, kind of like how things react in chemistry!

> ### 5. What is crossorigin in script tag?

crossorigin in a `<script>` tag is like a special passport for scripts from a different website. It tells the browser how to handle the request for that script:

**Security**: Normally, scripts can't access sensitive information from other websites (like cookies or login details). This is good for security reasons!
**Exception:** But sometimes, you might need a script from another website to work with your page. That's where crossorigin comes in.
**Passport control:** By adding crossorigin with specific values, you're basically authorizing the script and telling the browser what access to grant it. It's like giving the script a special passport with specific permissions.

#### Here are some common values for crossorigin:

**anonymous:** The script can't access any sensitive information, but it can still run and potentially interact with your page in other ways.
**use-credentials:** The script can access some sensitive information (like cookies) under certain conditions. This is riskier, so use it carefully.
Remember, using crossorigin involves security considerations. Only use it if you truly need a script from another website and understand the potential risks.

> ### 6. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

**React:** This is like your toolbox, containing all the materials and tools (components, state, hooks) you need to design and build the different parts of your house (like walls, doors, windows).
**ReactDOM:** This is like the specialized crew that takes your design and actually uses the tools from your toolbox to build the house on the ground (by rendering components in the browser's DOM).
In short:

**React:** Provides the core concepts and building blocks for creating user interfaces.
**ReactDOM:** Handles the interaction between React and the web browser, specifically by turning those React components into actual HTML elements visible on the page.
Both work together to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

> ### 7. What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

Think of it like tools for building a house:

**React.development.js:** The big toolbox with all the tools and instructions (comments) for building. Great for learning and fixing things. (Slower)

**React.production.js:** The lightweight tool belt with essentials for efficient work. Perfect for the actual construction (website). (Faster)

Use the toolbox for building and fixing, and the tool belt for the final work.
